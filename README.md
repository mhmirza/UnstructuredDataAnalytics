# Unstructured Data Analytics

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Unstructured Data Analytics**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2022. Since companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video, turning this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights has become a challenge. This course builds up on addressing this problem of first examining the possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Following this, it leverages upon several Machine Learning techniques to make predictions by exploiting this structure.

# Key Learnings

From the course, Unstructured Data Analytics, I gained an extensive understanding of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Key focus areas included frequency and co-occurrence analysis using metrics such as Phi-squared; Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Dimensionality Reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, Isomap and t-Distributed Dtochastic Neighbor Embedding; Clustering methods such as K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models (including hyperparameter optimization) and DP-means; Classification models such as K-NN and Random Forests; Image analysis with CNNs and time series analysis with RNNs. 

# Portfolio

Different tools in Python e.g. NLTK, Skicit-learn, spaCy, PyTorch were used for completion of projects and assignments below, using real world data.

## Final Project

**Brief Description:** "To prepare for large public health emergencies, the Allegheny County is prioritizing the list of Points of Dispense (PODs) to open, which are used to distribute essential supplies and medicines to the public during such emergencies. Your goal for this project is to formulate a facility location model, and optimally select a list of PODs from the candidate sites. You need to compare two different formulations: minimizing the total/weighted travel distance of the population, and minimizing the maximum travel distance for anyone."
