# Unstructured Data Analytics

This portfolio captures the work I completed for a course, **Unstructured Data Analytics**, at Carnegie Mellon University in Spring 2022. Since companies, governments, and other organizations now collect massive amounts of data such as text, images, audio, and video, turning this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights has become a challenge. This course builds up on addressing this problem of first examining the possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Following this, it leverages upon several Machine Learning techniques to make predictions by exploiting this structure.

# Key Learnings

From the course, Decision Analytics for Business & Policy, I learnt how to design end-to-end decision analytics pipelines by: identifying components of decision problems that are (not) susceptible to analytical modeling, and selecting the appropriate tools; translating decision problems to logical, mathematical formulations, and clearly identifying the objectives, decision variables, constraints, input/output; translating these mathematical formulations into code using [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) in Python; applying findings back to the decision problem context in business and policy through written and verbal communication.

## Final Project

**Brief Description:** "To prepare for large public health emergencies, the Allegheny County is prioritizing the list of Points of Dispense (PODs) to open, which are used to distribute essential supplies and medicines to the public during such emergencies. Your goal for this project is to formulate a facility location model, and optimally select a list of PODs from the candidate sites. You need to compare two different formulations: minimizing the total/weighted travel distance of the population, and minimizing the maximum travel distance for anyone."
